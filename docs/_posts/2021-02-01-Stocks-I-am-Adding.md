I have more buying power so I will be buying more SPACs. I am lazy so I will be gathering information from reddit posts but will do further research.

First we have $FPAC... A $550mm SPAC targeting fintech companies. This might be the move since the most well-known fintech, Robinhood, could be at its downfall, calling for newer and more customer-oriented fintech companies. We've seen Chamath's SPAC, $IPOE, moon since their SoFi merger intent. I don't know who $FPAC will target but since it's so close to the NAV, there's no risk to buying a couple shares to see where it goes.

Next we have $PACE... They've already announced a definitive agreement to merge with Nerdy and still is trading at $10.88. Nerdy is a platform for online tutoring and education. They've seen record profits due to quarantines and schools being closed over the last year. Basically what people are saying is that they are in an untapped and unhyped market with potential. Will also be buying up couple shares to see where it goes.

Next we have $VYGG... Reddit co-founder and CEO, Steve Huffman, is on the board of directors so this could very well mean this SPAC could be merging with Reddit (all speculation). Just like how CCIV has internal connections with Lucid motors. I will be buying in to see where this goes.  

That is it for now but I will be adding more throughout the week.
